## Technical Implementation

### Screen Time Tracking Limitations
Due to iOS privacy restrictions, this app cannot access the system's built-in Screen Time API. Instead, it tracks active usage time when the app is in focus using:

- **Page Visibility API**: Detects when the app tab is visible/hidden
- **Window Focus Events**: Handles app switching and tab changes
- **Local Storage**: Persists tracking data using Zustand with persistence

### Key Technologies
- **Next.js 14**: App Router for modern React development
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management with persistence
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Recharts**: Interactive data visualization
- **next-pwa**: PWA configuration and service worker
